# Sandwich_Shop
This a project I made for my "Principles of Computer Science II" class in Fall 2017.
The project is to create a software that will be able to take a client's order and calculate
the total cost of the meal including TAX. Moreover, I also used library such as AWT & SWING for Java
to come up with a graphical user interface too. Thus, fell free to take a look on the source code and bring some 
new features.
